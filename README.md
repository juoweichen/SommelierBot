# ft_sommelier
This project is the gateway to the machine learning branch. It will help you become a master sommelier!<br>
The goal of this project is to design a single neuron perceptron machine to distinguish between high and low quality wines!

**NOTE:** We are **ONLY** allowed to import and use the matplotlib, pandas, and the standard python
libraries for this project.<br>

**NOTE:** We are **NOT** allowed to use pandas DataFrame math/matrix methods (i.e. ‘.T’, ‘.transpose’, ‘.dot’, ‘.add’, ‘.divide’, ‘.mean’, ‘.std’, etc...). neither some other mathematics libraries like: numpy, scipy, scikit- learn, tensorflow, etc.<br>

## How to start
Launch jupyter notebook<br>
For installation, check out this: [Installing Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)<br>
open up ft_sommeliar.ipynb with jupyter notebook

## Data Description
A detailed chemical analysis has provided on a number of red and white wines (winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv). These analysis parameters include:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide 
- Total sulfur dioxide 
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
Beside above parameters, there's a “Quality” parameter which is a simulation of the score that three trained wine tasters would give the wine. Thus, each row in the dataset describes the chemical characteristics and quality score for a particular wine.

In order to have a better understanding on our data, we're been ask to draw a scatter matrix diagraph to show the distrubution of each parameters in pair for visual demonstration and comparison.

## Standarization

## Search for good learning rate

## Training and Validation

## Multi-dimension classification

## More stuff to leaen in the future...
